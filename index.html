          <h3>Who am I?</h3>
          <img src="assets/aidan_pavlik_suit.jpg" alt="Image of programming languages" />

          <p>I am a very quick and creative thinker.
          I also like to look for unconvential solutions to problems that most would not think of.
          I also like to think that I have a lot of common sense.
          More so than most people I know. This allows me to not overthink a simple problem.
          Finally, I firmly believe in not giving up and pushing through whatever you might be stuck on or troubling you.
          Because most of the time you will
          come out a better person because of it.

        <section id="about">
          <p>I am currently a second year ITM major at Illinois institute of technology.
              While I am learning the skills of ITM in general.
              I intend to specialize in software development.
              I also participate in different clubs/organizations at IIT.
              The biggest being the IIT Esports organization. With the help of a couple of friends,
              I also intend to start a DnD/Tabletop RPG club at some point this year.
