      <h3>Custom Search Engine</h3>


      <h2>Broken Down into 3 sections</h2>


      <ul id="SearchEngineList">
        <li>Web Scrapper</li>
        <p>The web crawler will take a starting link and it will begin scrapping at that link and will go a predefined
          distance before stopping.
          From there based on the Max pages and Max Length entered into the python file, it will go and start scraping
          the web and downloading HTML files using the start link as the basis.
          This was my first time ever using a web scraper, it may not be the best, but I feel that it is more than
          acceptable for the purpose of this assignment.</p>
        <li>Indexer</li>
        <p>The indexer will take all of the provided HTML documents obtained by the web crawler and it will create the
          inverted index using TF-IDF score/weight representation, Cosine similarity. It does this by extracting the
          text from the files and parsing it. It also has a built-in system to use stop words to help make it much more
          efficient.</p>


        <li>Processor</li>
        <p>The process is a Flask Based processor that is capable of using free text queries and uses JSON to handle
          them. It does this by creating a local Flask webserver to run everything and then when a POST request is made
          with the query, it uses the index that was already created to pull out the most relevant documents. It will
          continue running until the user manually shuts it down. This allows the user to enter as many queries as they
          wish without needing to restart everything.</p>
