            <p>Being a player</p>
            <p>I started playing DnD a little over a year ago and I have played many campaigns over the year</p>
            <p>I typically play a sneaky character that uses brain over brawn</p>
            <p>My favorite memory of being a player was when I knocked a teammate out which was definitely an accident</p>
            <p>Being a DM</p>
            <p>I have created and DMed one campaign that lasted 6 momths and I am currently creating a sequal to that</p>
            <p>They are both take place in the Warhammer Fantasy world</p>
            <p>I enjoyed creating painful puzzles for my players to complete for my own amusment</p>

            <p>I am currently on the IIT Overwatch team</p>
            <p>This is my second year on the team for which I am a tank player</p>
            <p>I truly enjoy being on the team as playing with teammates is a very different experience from playing the game on my own</p>
