        <h2>About</h2>
      </article>
      <p>I am currently a second year ITM major at Illinois institute of technology.
        While I am learning the skills of ITM in general.
        I intend to specialize in software development.
        I also participate in different clubs/organizations at IIT.
        The biggest being the IIT Esports organization. With the help of a couple of friends,
        I also intend to start a DnD/Tabletop RPG club at some point this year.

      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>I am a very quick and creative thinker.
        I also like to look for unconvential solutions to problems that most would not think of.
        I also like to think that I have a lot of common sense.
        More so than most people I know. This allows me to not overthink a simple problem.
        Finally, I firmly believe in not giving up and pushing through whatever you might be stuck on or troubling you.
        Because most of the time you will
        come out a better person because of it.
